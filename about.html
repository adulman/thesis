	<h6>&quot;DOES THIS CHURCH HAVE WIFI?&quot; was a direct quote said by me during my semester abroad in Florence, Italy last spring.</h6>
</div>

<div class="aboutcontent">
	<p>We were on a class field trip to some small town in Italy to see a few churches with our art history professor. There was a roof of the church that you could climb to and see a beautiful view of the town, but our group was too big, so half of us had to stay behind while half climbed. Sitting around bored, waiting to ascend the stairs, I jokingly said to my friends &quot;does this church have wifi?&quot; and it became a catchphrase during our semester abroad.</p>
	<br>
	<p>As I continued to travel across Europe for the next few months, searching for wifi was a constant struggle, and the total number of churches that this Jewish girl explored came to over sixty. I learned a lot about myself.... probably in large part thanks to my lack of wifi and the resulting amount of time I was left to my thoughts. I found a love for detailed planning of our weekend trips, and I found an even greater love for sharing my plans and knowledge with my friends. </p>
	<h3><font color=#45c3d0>This project is as much a satire of myself and my generation as it is a serious, thoughtful undertaking.</font></h3>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>The information in these guides is real, based off of my own experiences or those of my friends, and I truly believe in its usefulness to fellow travelers. However, I also know that thinking up the perfect Instagram caption can be just as difficult as planning an entire weekend in a city, so it is my hope that these guides can inform and ease the traveling experiences of basic b*tches everywhere.</p>
